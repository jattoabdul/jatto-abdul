          I am a versatile fullstack software engineer and a tech evangelist. Iâ€™m constantly in pursuit of knowledge, not just to update myself but to improve the quality of the team I work with and better the lives of people around me.

        <p>
          I enjoy setting up opportunities for learning. Co-founded the Freecodecamp Ilorin Group, served as mentor in various djangogirls events, teencode and other meetups. I also write technical and non-technical articles alike.I am constantly in pursuit of knowledge and challenging opportunities, not just to positively impact my growth, but to improve the quality of the teams I work with and better the lives of people around me.

          When I am not writing code or participating in online coding / algorithm challenges/games, I like to engage in some sporting activities. I do a martial art-taekwondo for self defense and sometimes I can be found playing soccer or video games.
